# app_template

A node.js application template for quick deployment or prototyping.

The template provides functionality and connectivity for some popular messaging, data storage and communications platforms.
It was written as an exercise in learning node.js, version control and testing out ideas in the course of my working life.

It will be quite obvious from a cursory glance at the code that I am in no way a developer of any significance, however I've found it a fun way to while away soem free time.
